#The data is now in a 'tibble' (like a spreadsheet for R). Let's use the head function to look at the first few rows:

#Now we use a loop to run through all the rows in our dataset (country-year combinations). For each row we will repeat the Gini coefficient calculation from R walk-through 5.4 and save the resulting value in the gini variable we created.
#The function that calculates Gini coefficients from a vector of numbers is called Gini,and we apply it to the income deciles

#With this code, we calculated 4,799 Gini coefficients without having to manually run the same command 4,799 times. We now look at some summary measures for the gini variable.
